This module provides the common synchronization and reset signaling logic and is closely based
on the example provided by Xilinx as part of the gig_ethernet_pcs_pma IP core part of Vivado 2019.2

The only reason this module is needed is the need to use non-differential clock for 625 MHz input
which is not possible when one selects the shared logic to be included in the IP core. Then only
differential clock input is available (see hdl/gig_ethernet_pcs_pma_clock_reset.vhd.patch
for comparison of the logic changes based on the original example source).
